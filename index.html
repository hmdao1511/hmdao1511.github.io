            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>My name is 陶海明, currently studying Computer Science at a university. I am super interested in computer science in general, as well as learning human languages! (Currently studying Japanese seriously and learning Esperanto for fun!). Looking forward to getting a job someday in the near future to fund my tuition fee for a bachelor in Japanese :) </p>  
            <h1>What is this personal blog all about?</h1>
            <p>Well, basically everything that revolves around me! Personal lifestyles, tips and tricks that I have learnt, my experience about something specific,... You name it!</p>
            <p>I will upload a post once in a while, so be sure to keep an eye on that!</p>
            <p>(Well, it's not that I'm into pirates or something... eeck!)</p>
            <h1>Extra content for those who are interested in learning the Japanese language</h1>
            <p>I love Japan, I simply love everything about it. The people, the manners, the culture, the language itself,... those things are beautiful! (Well I'm into Japanese just because I also like Anime :] ) </p>
            <p>Having said that, I'll be uploading posts about the Japanese language as well, including grammar and Kanji (gosh Kanji is such a hassle... but anyway I love it so what's the point of complaining XD), so make sure to check those post out too!</p>
